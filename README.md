# IN-DEVELOPMENT: CodeStructures ðŸ“š : A Web Application for Learning Data Structures and Algorithms

This web application is designed to help beginners understand and learn Data Structures and Algorithms using the following languages Python, C, C++ and Java.

## Introduction

Welcome to our web application, which is designed to facilitate the learning and understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in mainstream programming languages like Python, C++, and Java. Our core idea is to create a comprehensive library that can teach you DSA through a set of functions for creating and manipulating data structures such as arrays, lists, queues, trees and graphs.

The library is currently in the early stages of development, and we are using it as a tool for project-based learning. We are actively learning about DSA and using this project to gain hands-on experience in implementing various data structures and algorithms. A web application of an online compiler/interpreter will host this library, and is designed to be user-friendly and accessible and allow students to learn and code side by side. 

One of the unique features of this library will be the 'Understand' parameter in each function. When set to true, this parameter provides a detailed explanation of how the respective data structure is created or manipulated. This feature is designed to enhance the learning process by not only providing the output but also explaining the process behind it.

In addition to the creation and manipulation of data structures, the library also includes functions for implementing various algorithms. It also has the capability to cross-check the output of these algorithms, identify errors, and provide resources for users to verify their solutions.

## Project Status

We are currently focusing on developing the Python library, as it offers a wide range of features and is highly versatile, making it an excellent starting point for understanding DSA. We plan to release the Python Only Version of the web applicataion by the end of 2023.

Our current focus is on creating analogies to explain DSA in the most natural way possible, as well as creating classes of Data Structures that students can interact with to get a sense of how these Data Structures are used and their capabilities before writing code to try to build these classes themselves.

Our next big milestone is to develop libraries for C, C++, and Java. We aim to have these libraries ready by the end of February 2024.

## Conclusion

Our ultimate goal is to develop an online compiler/interpreter application and a set of libraries that can be used by both students and professional programmers to better understand and implement DSA. We intend to continuously expand the library with new features that will benefit the programming community as a whole, and we may even venture into teaching programming languages some time in the future. 

Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
