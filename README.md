# IN-PROGRESS: CodeStructures ðŸ“š

## Introduction

Welcome to our web application, which is designed to facilitate the learning and understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in mainstream programming languages like Python, C++, and Java. Our core idea is to create a comprehensive library that can teach you DSA through a set of functions for creating and manipulating data structures such as arrays, lists, queues, trees and graphs.

The library is currently in the early stages of development, and we are using it as a tool for project-based learning. We are actively learning about DSA and using this project to gain hands-on experience in implementing various data structures and algorithms.

One of the unique features of this library will be the 'Understand' parameter in each function. When set to true, this parameter provides a detailed explanation of how the respective data structure is created or manipulated. This feature is designed to enhance the learning process by not only providing the output but also explaining the process behind it.

In addition to the creation and manipulation of data structures, the library also includes functions for implementing various algorithms. It also has the capability to cross-check the output of these algorithms, identify errors, and provide resources for users to verify their solutions.

We are currently focusing on developing the Python library, as it offers a wide range of features and is highly versatile and is the easiest place to start understanding DSA. A web application of an online compiler/interpreter will host this library, and is designed to be user-friendly and accessible.

Our ultimate goal is to create an online complier/interpreter application and a library that can be a valuable tool for both students and professional programmers, helping them to understand and implement DSA more effectively. We aim to continuously expand the library with other functionalities that could be beneficial to the programming community as a whole. Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
